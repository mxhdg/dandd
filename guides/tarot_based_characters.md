# 🃏 Tarot-Based Character Creation for Dungeons & Dragons

Blend mysticism with storytelling and stat generation using tarot cards to create rich, emotionally resonant D&D characters.

---

## 🔮 Overview

Tarot cards offer archetypes, symbolism, and narrative tension—perfect for character-driven roleplay. This method can shape backstories, influence stats, and inspire campaign arcs.

---

## 🧠 Methods of Use

### 1. Backstory & Personality

Use tarot spreads to define your character’s emotional journey:

- **Three-Card Spread**  
  - *Past*: What shaped them  
  - *Present*: What drives them now  
  - *Future*: What they’re destined for

- **Major Arcana Archetypes**  
  - *The Fool*: Naive adventurer  
  - *The Tower*: Trauma survivor  
  - *The Lovers*: Driven by connection

### 2. Stat Generation

Use tarot suits and card ranks to influence ability scores.

#### 🗡️ Suit-to-Stat Mapping

| Tarot Suit   | D&D Stat Options              |
|--------------|-------------------------------|
| Cups         | Wisdom or Charisma            |
| Swords       | Strength or Dexterity         |
| Pentacles    | Constitution or Intelligence  |
| Wands        | Intelligence or Dexterity     |

#### 🧮 Rank-Based Values

- **Numeric Cards**: Use card number directly (Ace = 1, King = 13)  
- **Court Cards**: Assign modifiers  
  - Page = +1  
  - Knight = +2  
  - Queen = +3  
  - King = +4

#### 🧠 Symbolic Interpretation

Use card meanings to adjust stats:

- *The Magician* → Boost Intelligence or Charisma  
- *The Hermit* → High Wisdom, low Charisma  
- *Strength* → High Constitution or Strength

### 3. Character Arcs & Campaign Hooks

Use spreads like *Creator, Sustainer, Destroyer* to define narrative tension.

| Role       | Tarot Example     | Interpretation                        |
|------------|-------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Creator    | The Lovers        | Seeks connection or unity              |
| Sustainer  | The Hierophant    | Anchored by tradition or belief        |
| Destroyer  | Death             | Must face change, loss, or rebirth     |

## 🧙‍♀️ Why It Works

Tarot encourages nonlinear growth, emotional depth, and symbolic storytelling. It’s ideal for players who want to explore transformation, mystery, and personal quests.

---

## 💡 Optional: Tarot Mode for Statling

Consider adding a “Tarot Mode” to *Statling*:

- Draw cards to generate character prompts  
- Auto-assign stat modifiers based on suit/rank  
- Suggest narrative arcs based on spreads

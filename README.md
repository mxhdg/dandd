## **Appearance**
Elowen stands at 5'7" with a lean, agile build that reflects her active lifestyle. Her grey eyes carry a piercing, introspective gaze, hinting at quiet determination and a deep connection to nature. Her brown hair, lightened to a warm chestnut from years under the sun, frames her sun-kissed face, which is speckled with faint freckles across her nose and cheeks.  

Though her journey is just beginning, her complexion shows a balance of ruggedness from the outdoors and the unpolished grace of her elven heritage. A wooden elven flute, intricately carved with leaf patterns, rests among her belongings—a subtle reminder of her roots.

## **Backstory**
Elowen Turnerleaf grew up as a bridge between two worlds—her elven mother’s quiet, solitary life in the forest and her human father’s boisterous existence at sea. From her mother, she learned to track, forage, and thrive alone in the wilderness, honing her independence and survival instincts. From her father, she inherited a restless wanderlust and a wary eye, trusting few and relying on herself above all.  

At 34, Elowen is at the beginning of her journey, blending the teachings of her parents into a path all her own. Her practical gear reflects her days spent under open skies, while the shine of newness in her armor hints at an adventurer still finding her footing. Her wooden elven flute, intricately carved with leaf motifs, is a sentimental relic of her roots, though rarely played.  

In her fire-breathing rabbit companion, Doug, she finds a reflection of her own fiery determination—an unpredictable but fiercely loyal bond that grounds her in the chaotic wilderness she calls home.
